# Changelog

## 2025-11-04

### Latest - Enhanced dashboard and single-command launcher
- Implemented grouped dashboard monitor with functional organization:
  - SENSORS section: Shows latest data from all sensor ECUs (wheels, engine, steering)
  - CONTROLLER section: Displays autonomous controller TX (commands sent) and RX (sensor data received)
  - ACTUATORS section: Shows actuator ECUs receiving commands
- Added single-command launcher `cargo run`:
  - Automatically starts all 9 ECUs in background (sensors, controller, actuators)
  - Suppresses individual ECU logs for clean output
- Dashboard:
  - Real-time CAN traffic visualization
  - Press 'q' to quit and cleanly shutdown all components

### b6e91423 - inital implementation of autonomous controller
- Moved original implementation to `basic/` folder
- Created `autonomous_controller/` project with 9-ECU automotive architecture:
  - Sensors: 4x wheel speed, engine, steering
  - Controller: Autonomous decision-making
  - Actuators: Brake and steering control
- Automotive CAN IDs (0x100-0x3FF), data encoding/decoding helpers
- Safety features: Brake/steering limiting, anomaly detection
- Realistic simulation: 10-20 Hz broadcasts, noise injection, smooth actuator transitions
- Enhanced monitor with automotive message decoding
- Comprehensive documentation and security research guide
